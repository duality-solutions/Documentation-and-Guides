# Duality Blockchain Solutions LLC

## What is Duality?
“Duality” is a community-driven project that emerged during the 2014 altcoin boom and took its final form in 2017 as Duality Blockchain Solutions LLC. We at Duality believe that real innovation happens at the fringe by real people with pragmatic answers and prompt implementations to fundamental problems. Duality, as a social construct, aspires to evolve by staying true to its roots.

## Our Mission

## Our Vision

## Our Values
To provide financial sovereignty and improve societal standards in a world of increasing austerity.
