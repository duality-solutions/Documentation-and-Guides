# Duality Blockchain Solutions LLC

## What is Duality?
Duality provides solutions for secure data storage and verification to both companies and the public through the use of a hybrid public/private network.

Data is stored securely and verified automatically via a shared ledger, supported by the two blockchains Sequence(SEQ) and Dynamic(DYN).

This removes the requirement for many needed resources, third-parties, maintenance, unneeded costs and time.

## Documentation Guide
Next you see Documentation which shows you certain guides with the Dynamic and Sequence blockchains. Finally you have the about section which hosts everything else such as license, faqs, etc.

Here is an index of the different PDF documents which we include in documentation:
