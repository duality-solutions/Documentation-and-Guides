# Duality Blockchain Solutions LLC

## What is Duality?
Duality provides solutions for secure data storage and verification to both companies and the public through the use of a hybrid public/private network.

Data is stored securely and verified automatically via a shared ledger, supported by the two blockchains Sequence(SEQ) and Dynamic(DYN).

This removes the requirement for many needed resources, third-parties, maintenance, unneeded costs and time.

## Documentation Guide
Under Technology you can find our major improvements we have added to Dynamic. Next you see Documentation which shows you certain guides with the Dynamic and Sequence blockchains. Finally you have the about section which hosts everything else such as license, faqs, etc.

Here is an index of the different PDF documents which we include in documentation:

* [Dynamic Bootstrap Instructions](Dynamic(DYN) Bootstrap Instructions.pdf)
* [Dynode Setup Guide](Dynode-Setup-Guide.pdf)
* [How to Setup Sequence Staking using a Raspberry Pi Guide]([HOW TO] Stake Sequence Using Rasp-Pi.pdf)
* [Staking Sequence Guide](Sequence_Staking_Guide.pdf)

## About
This document and guide repository is a mkdocs project built with `mkdocs-material`. You can view an active version [here](http://duality-solutions.github.io). We included the mkdocs.yml file here in the repository for you to create it on your own if you wish.
