# FAQ

## GENERAL

### What is Duality?
Duality provides solutions for secure data storage and verification, both to companies and the public through the use of a public network of nodes. 
Data is stored securely and verified automatically via a shared ledger, supported by the two blockchains Sequence(SEQ) and Dynamic(DYN). This removes the requirement for many needed resources, third-parties, maintenance, unneeded costs and time.

### What is BDAP?
BDAP adds users, groups, linking and domains to our decentralized blockchains( like a phonebook) helping facilitate BaaS applications and services.

### What is BaaS?
BaaS brings blockchain to non-blockchain businesses, solving critical privacy/security issues, lowering overhead and risk of unauthorized data access.

### What is NoID?
NoID connects biometric data to a persons healthcare records. NoID is a much safer patient identifier than what is currently available and ultimately saves lives.

### What is pShare?
pShare is a Privacy oriented peer to peer file and folder sharing application allowing the sharing of data with explicit authorization.

### What is pSign?
pSign is a document signature and workflow application, allowing secure digital signing and providing templates, libraries and full automation.


##DYNAMIC

### What mining algorithm does Dynamic use and why?
Dynamic uses Argon2d, which is specifically designed to be much harder for specialised hardware such as ASICs, as it is memory-hard and scalable.

### What difficulty retarget algorithm does Dynamic use and why?
Dynamic uses Digishield V3 to retarget the difficulty of mining as more miners join or as miners leave. This has been chosen at it produced the most balanced results in terms of retargeting and protects against multi-pools.

### How often does the mining difficulty retarget?
Digishield V3 retargets the difficulty of mining each block.

### How long does a transfer take to fully confirm on the blockchain?
It takes a total of 10 blocks after the transfer is sent for it to fully confirm on the Dynamic blockchain.

### What is the reward rate for miners of Dynamic?
Currently the reward rate is 1 Dynamic but can be controlled via the use of the Fluid Protocol, which would change the reward within 2 blocks.

### How do I mine Dynamic?
Dynamic can be mined by using your CPU. Simply download Dynamic and once fully synced with the network you can select the "Mining" tab and start mining.

### How many Dynamic do I need to run a Dynode?
To run a Dynode you require exactly 1000 Dynamic.

### What's the reward rate for Dynodes?
We try to keep the reward rate above 14.6% per annum. As coins in circulation increases Duality will amend reward rates to keep the ROI in check.

### How many confirmations do I need before I can start my Dynode?
To start your Dynode you must wait for your collateral transfer of 1000 DYN to have 17 confirmations.

### How do I setup a Dynode?
To setup a Dynode you can either follow our Dynode Setup Guide, if you are having issues come and join our Discord where we will be happy to assist.

### What is the minimum transfer fee?
The minimum transfer fee is 0.0001 Dynamic.

### What is the Dynamic blockchains block size?
The size of a block on the Dynamic blockchain is a maximum of 4MB.

### How many Dynamic could be in circulation after all rewards are produced?
The total number of Dynamic that could end up in circulation after millennia is 263-1 or in other terms 9,223,372,036,854,775,806.

### What is InstantSend?
InstantSend is a utility to automatically verify and settle a payment within seconds. Fees and costs normally incurred by transferring funds quickly are reduced via the use of blockchain technology.

### What is Fluid Protocol?
Fluid allows Duality to make crucial changes within minutes to blockchain parameters, without the need for users to change the software they are using or interrupt the network.

## SEQUENCE

### What mining algorithm does Sequence use and why?
Sequence uses Blake2b, which has been adopted by many projects due to its high speed, security, and simplicity. Blake2b is optimized for 64-bit platformsâ€”including NEON-enabled ARMs.

### What difficulty retarget algorithm does Sequence use and why?
The difficulty retarget algorithm of Sequence is based upon that of Bitcoins and does not have a spoecific name as such. It provides balanced retargeting to the stake mining difficulty.

### How often does the staking difficulty retarget?
The staking difficulty retargets every 10 blocks.

### How long does a transfer take to fully confirm on the blockchain?
It takes a total of 10 blocks after the transfer is sent for it to fully confirm on the Sequence blockchain.

### What is the reward rate for stakers of Sequence?
The reward rate is 2 Sequence per block.

### How do I stake Sequence?
Leave your wallet online unlocked or unlocked for staking only.

### How many coins do I need to stake?
The weight of your wallet will increase your stake potential. Having no Sequence means you will not receive any stake. There is no cap that leads to a maximum amount.

### How long until I receive the first stake?
This depends on your stake weight. Take into consideration that there are about 45mm coins in circulation and about 1350 blocks created each day.

### Is there an optimal setup for staking?
To configure Sequence to stake optimally it is advised to follow our Sequence Staking Guide, if you are having issues come and join our Discord where we will be happy to assist.

### What is the minimum transfer fee?
The minimum transfer fee is 0.001 Sequence.

### What is Sequence blockchains block size?
The size of a block on the Sequence blockchain is a maximum of 4MB.

### How many Sequence could be in circulation after all rewards are produced?
The total number of Sequence (SEQ) that could end up in circulation after millennia is 263-1 or in other terms 9,223,372,036,854,775,806.
